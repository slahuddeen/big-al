This is a reimagining of the original Big Al dinosaur game made by the BBC in the 2000s.
Ive added a few things to it and changed a few things too:
•	Movement is now done by clicking on a tile you want to go to
•	There are hex based tiles instead of squares
•	There is a world generation algorithm to may every playthrough different
•	Ive added more Jurassic era Morison Formation animals to the game
•	Hex tiles have special properties such as vision or thirst effects

Im still developing these features:
•	A pack hunting system
•	A sauropod hunting minigame
•	More attack types as you grow and hunt different animals (pokemon like system)
•	A territory system
•	More animals and biomes with unique effects

You can play the original game as well as a faithful rebuild of it here:
